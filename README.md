# _Beep Boop Counter_

#### _Application to take a number input from the user and return a list counting from zero to that number, current version: Nov 2019_

#### By _**Alyssa Colistro**_

## Description

_This application is designed to take a number string from the user, parse the string into an integer/number datatype, generate an output counting from 0 through the given number and output each count into a list that is shown to the user after they hit submit. There are special rules, though. If the number includes a "1", "2", or "3", the application will return a message in place of that number._

_I experienced a lot of bugs while building this, so user beware._

## Known Bugs

_As stated above, I encountered many bugs with loops, syntax and other functionality while building this application. As is currently is, the list that should be populated with the for loop and function within remains empty when user submits their number. The version available on the branch "testdebug" allows for the list to populate, but it populates with an [unidentified object]. There are n known workarounds in it's current state. Also, if the user enters a non-number character in their string, the application will not run as intended_
